Financial sector development is important as it makes available funds for the development of the country by efficient allocation of financial resources. In this paper we our objective was to analyze the measurement of Financial Development in both the domains of institutions and markets across access, depth and efficiency. Through our empirical study of 173 countries for the year 2017 by using the plausible indicators of potentials determinants such as legal traditions, quality of institutions, financial openness, political environment and other macroeconomic variables we found out that GDP per capita PPP, commercial bank branches per 100000 adults, political stability, govt effectiveness and trade openness significantly affect Financial Development of a nations positively.

Also, after a contrasting study we found out that Trade openness significantly impact the level of financial development in a positive manner, and the exports and imports of goods and services is much more important to developed nations than developing nations because wealthy nations have more trade dependent financial sectors. For developing nations regulatory quality and rule of law in the country plays significant part to grow positively for financial development so as to cultivate a safer environment promising for cultivating financial needs of nation.
